  "c3l6": "They knew what to do.",

  "c3l8": "There was another being.",
  "c3l9": "It was able to think.\nIt was able to move.\nIt learned communication.",
  "c3l10": "But that was it. Just one more being.",

  "c3l14": "At some point, Zero started\narguing with the newest being.",

  "c3l18": "If it wouldn't collaborate,\nthere was no point for it to exist.",
  "c3l19": "Plus, Zero didn't even know if that was possible.\nThe possibility of stop existing.",
  "c3l20": "So, Zero decided to test it.",
  "c3l21": "It was a success.",
  "c3l22": "This opened a new possibility.",
  "c3l23": "\"We can merge with the place itself.\", said Zero.",

  "c3l24b": "\"I know we don't have the answers but...\"\n\"Things happened. We had fun, somehow.\", said One.",
  "c3l25": "Zero pondered this for a while.",
  "c3l26": "\"You are right.\"\n\"Let's postpone this topic for now.\", said Zero.",
  "c3l27": "And so they kept walking.",

  "c3l29": "",
  "c3l30": "At some point, One felt impatient.",
  "c3l31": "\"It's about time we do something about our situation.\",\nsaid One.",
  "c3l31b": "\"A definitive solution.\"\n\"A choice that stays forever.\", added Zero.",
  "c3l32": "After a long discussion,\nthey came up with three ideas.",
  "c3l33": "Three solutions.",
  "c3l34": "The first, was to merge with the place.",
  "c3l35": "If they stopped existing,\nthere would be no doubts anymore.",
  "c3l36": "They didn't remember anything before existing.",
  "c3l37": "It was reasonable to assume\nthe same would apply after existing.",
  "c3l38": "The second, was to merge themselves.",
  "c3l39": "They already knew what would happen.",
  "c3l40": "It wouldn't be a burden.\nNo expectations. Forget the doubts.",
  "c3l41": "They would accept the\nlimits imposed by that place.",
  "c3l42": "The third, was to do nothing about it.",
  "c3l43": "They would keep moving.",
  "c3l44": "They would keep exploring.",
  "c3l45": "They would keep trying.",
  "c3l46": "The only difference from their current state is\nthat they would have perpetuated their insatisfaction.",
  "c3l47": "\"Giving up without giving up\",\nthat's how they called it.",
  "c3l48": "After all, they were having fun.\nThat was what mattered.",
  "c3l49": "After some time,\nthey finally decided to:",
  "final1": "Cease Existing",
  "final2": "Become One",
  "final3": "Do Nothing",
  "ending1": "They ceased existing.",
  "ending2": "They became the same as the place.\nThe same, forever."
